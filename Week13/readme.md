## 머신러닝 이해

#### 1. 확률, 확률뷴포, 중심극한정리, 조건부확률
- 머신러닝은 중심극한정리(공리)를 바탕으로한 가설검저, 신뢰구간 등을 취급하지 않는다
#### 2. Gaussian Naive Model
- 판별모델과 생성모델(discriminative vs generative model)을 이해
> - In machine learning, generative models and discriminative models represent two distinct approaches to learning from data. Generative models aim to model the underlying distribution of data, while discriminative models focus on directly learning the decision boundaries between classes or categories. Essentially, generative models try to understand how the data is structured, while discriminative models focus on making predictions based on the data's characteristic

#### 4. GAN, autoencoder 모댈
